            We offer weekly stock recommendations: what stocks to buy, at what price, how much of it to buy, and when to
            sell them again<br />
            <br />
            Use it to better your investment performance, as these recommendations offer something unusual: higher
            expected reward along with a lower expected risk.<br />
            <br />
            Using Formula Stocks is easy, too. After logging in you will find purchase and sales suggestions for stocks
            trading on all US stock exchanges including large international stocks. These can be traded from anywhere in
            the world, through any bank or broker you already use.<br />
            <br />
            You can use these suggestions individually or choose to replicate our model portfolio. Simply follow the
            instructions, and you will be handling your own account in no time at all.
