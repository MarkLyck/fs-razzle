      Formula Stocks uses a combination of many specific technologies developed over a 15- year period to do as Mark
      Twain originally suggested:
      <br />
      <br />
      ”Buy good quality common stocks that go up. If they do not go up, do not buy them”. While Twain said it
      tongue-in-cheek, it encapsulates Formula Stocks' mission.<br />
      <br />
      We identify stocks that go up, before they go up, with a 88-92% probability of being correct.
