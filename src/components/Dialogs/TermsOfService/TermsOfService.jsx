        B) BUSINESS plan:<br />

        regards AUM under the provision that it is only used within one legal entity. It is possible to use FUND for a
        distributed commercial product, such as a fund, ETF, other investment vehicle or other forms of institutional
        capital. Please contact a Formula Stocks representative for further details.

      <h3>General</h3>

      <p>
        FORMULA STOCKS is an Internet based publication, and as such not registered as an investment adviser with any
        national, federal or state regulatory agency, or in any other regulatory capacity. To the extent that any
        portion of the Formula Stocks website would need to rely upon such an exemption, FORMULA STOCKS would rely upon
        the “publisher’s exclusion” from the definition of “investment adviser” as provided under Section 202(a)(11) of
        the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and corresponding state securities laws. To the extent reliance on the
        publisher’s exemption is necessary, the FORMULA STOCKS plans are bona fide publications of general and regular
        circulation offering impersonalized investment-related information to users and/or prospective users (e.g., not
        tailored to the specific investment portfolio or needs of current and/or prospective users).<br />
        <br />
        FORMULA STOCKS is not an investment advisory service, nor a registered investment advisor and does not offer
        individual investment advice. FORMULA STOCKS does not manage client funds, but act solely as an information and
        technology supplier and publisher. The user maintains absolute discretion as to whether or not to follow any
        portion of the FORMULA STOCKS content. It remains the user’s exclusive responsibility to review and evaluate the
        content and to determine whether to accept or reject any content. FORMULA STOCKS expresses no opinion as to
        whether any of the website content is appropriate for a user’s investment portfolio, strategy, financial
        situation, or investment objective(s). FORMULA STOCKS does not purport to tell or suggest which securities
        individual customers should buy or sell for themselves. FORMULA STOCKS purchase or sell indications, are not
        solicitations to buy or sell, but rather, information the user can use as a starting point for doing additional
        independent research in order to allow you to form your own opinion regarding investments, and make your own
        informed decisions.<br />
        <br />
        It is the user’s exclusive responsibility to determine if any portion of the investment-related information is
        suitable or appropriate for his/her financial situation and/or investment objectives, both initially and on an
        ongoing basis. No current or prospective user should assume that the future performance of any specific
        investment, investment strategy, or any other website content will be suitable or profitable for a user’s
        portfolio, equal historical or anticipated performance levels.<br />
        <br />
        Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific
        investment will either be suitable or profitable for a user or prospective user’s investment portfolio. Users do
        not receive investment advisory, investment supervisory or investment management services, nor an initial or
        ongoing review or monitoring of the user’s individual investment portfolio or individual particular needs.
        Therefore, no user should assume that his or hers use serves as a substitute for individual personalized advice
        from an investment professional of the user’s choosing.<br />
        <br />
        The supplied information is provided solely for educational and informational purposes and may not be construed
        as an offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell, any financial instrument or to engage
        in any specific strategy or as an official confirmation of terms.<br />
        <br />
        It should not be assumed that the systems presented in these products will be profitable or that they will not
        result in losses. Past results of any investment system published by Formula Stocks are not necessarily
        indicative of future returns. In addition, information, system output, articles and other features of our
        products are provided for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment
        advice. Accordingly, you should not rely solely on this information in making any investment. You should check
        with your licensed financial advisor and tax advisor to determine the suitability of any investment, and/or read
        relevant prospectuses, while taking into account your own financial situation and objectives.FORMULA STOCKS
        plans vary in terms of diversification, and may or may not be adequately diversified for any particular risk
        profile as the required level of diversification differs from individual to individual. Set your own individual
        maximum position size accordingly or consult an advisor.<br />
        <br />
        The Formula Stocks website makes use of strategies which have been backtested. Formula Stocks strategies only
        became available in 2009, and have performed very well in the 2009-2017 timeframe. Backtested performance
        results however, have certain inherent limitations, as they could potentially be designed with some benefit of
        hindsight, even though best efforts has been taken to avoid such risk. Unlike an actual performance record,
        backtested results do not represent actual trading and may not be impacted by brokerage and other slippage fees.
        Also, since transactions may or may not actually have been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated
        for impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of market liquidity or level of participation. NO
        REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.<br />
        <br />
        FORMULA STOCKS business analytics depend on the accuracy of the published accounts of public corporations. Such
        accuracy may from time to time be less than ideal. FORMULA STOCKS strategies evolve and improve on a recurring
        basis, and any result and statistic is therefore subject to change without notice. FORMULA STOCKS employees may
        or may not own equities mentioned in the service.<br />
        <br />
        For users of our “BUSINESS” plan service only (does not apply to “BASIC” or “PREMIUM” plan members): The
        BUSINESS service is intended for what is generally known as accredited or sophisticated investors, or
        corporations/businesses. The exact definition of accredited and sophisticated varies between countries,
        generally referring to either a certain net worth, income, or professional status, status as a corporation or
        financial institution or business with relation to the investment field. In the US it could imply either a net
        worth in excess of 1 mio. USD, excluding value of primary residence, or alternatively an annual income of at
        least 200,000 USD, or other factors as defined in regulations, such as status as an investment company, bank,
        insurance company, charitable organization with a certain amount of assets, and many other designations. Using
        BUSINESS does require some knowledge about investments in general, due to its focused nature, and if you sign up
        to the BUSINESS plan, you indicate that you can be considered either A) a sophisticated or accredited investor
        based upon either the rules of definition in your country of residence, or B) Represent a corporation/business
        which by definition enlists the services of tax or financial advisors, or C) by your own definition meet similar
        standards of investment knowledge where this may be applicable.<br />
        <br />
        There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial products.
        Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully in the context of their own personal
        financial situation before investing.<br />
        <br />
        We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.<br />

        damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted,
        transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some
        states, countries or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential
        or incidental damages, in such states, countries or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum
        extent permitted by law.<br />

        such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the
        unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not
        affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

      <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>
        Neither party shall be liable to the other for any failure to perform any obligation under any Agreement which

        forthwith inform the other Party of the same and shall use all reasonable endeavours to comply with the terms
        and conditions of any Agreement contained herein.
      </p>

      <h3>Waiver</h3>

      <p>
        Failure of either Party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this or any Agreement or the
        failure of either Party to exercise any right or remedy to which it, he or they are entitled hereunder shall not
        constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of the obligations under this or any Agreement. No
        waiver of any of the provisions of this or any Agreement shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be
        such and signed by both Parties.

        continue to apply. Failure of the Company to enforce any of the provisions set out in these Terms and Conditions
        and any Agreement, or failure to exercise any option to terminate, shall not be construed as waiver of such
        provisions and shall not affect the validity of these Terms and Conditions or of any Agreement or any part
        thereof, or the right thereafter to enforce each and every provision. These Terms and Conditions shall not be
        amended, modified, varied or supplemented except in writing and signed by duly authorised representatives of the
