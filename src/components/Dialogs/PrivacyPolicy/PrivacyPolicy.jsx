        <br />
        When you browse our website or application, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP)
        address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
        <br />
        <br />
        Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our website or application,
        new products and other updates.
      </p>

      <h3>Consent</h3>
      <p>
        When you provide us with personal information, when you register an account, complete a transaction, verify your
        credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase or give us your information in any
        other way, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.<br />
        <br />
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly
        for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <h3>Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
        Service.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then FORMULA STOCKS stores your credit card
        data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase
        transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is
        complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.<br />
        <br />
        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
        Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.<br />
        <br />
        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our website and its service
        providers.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
        extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.<br />
        <br />
        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
        processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for
        your purchase-related transactions.<br />
        <br />
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which
        your personal information will be handled by these providers.<br />
        <br />
        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different
        jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of
        a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
        which that service provider or its facilities are located.<br />
        <br />
        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in
        the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
        disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.<br />
        <br />
        Once you leave our website or application or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
        longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

        sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.<br />
        <br />
        If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
        technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
        electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally
        accepted industry standards.
